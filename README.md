# Porfolio app

This app created with React showcases my portfolio. I keep changing/updating the designs. Please check it out [here](https://federicoverly-56c58.web.app/)

## Running the app

Donwload the zip or clone the repository. Install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Once dependencies are installed, run

```bash
npm start
```

## Libraries

### Firebase

Firestore is used for the storage of videos. Make sure to explore [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

### React-router-dom

This library is used to handle the navigation between different components, even allowing different renders based on the url passed using the useParams hook. [Here](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) more!

### Aos

Animate On Scroll Library, looks awesome! [Here](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
